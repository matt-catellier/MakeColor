A simple hex color library for iOS developers.

By Matt Catellier and Cheng Jiang

Make Color is a lightweight and easy to use SWIFT library created to programatically change assign color using hex values. Coming from a web background, the RGB color system of SWIFT and XCODE can be a little confusing, so we made 7 simple functions to help you out. There are also a number of built in color schemes taht we have set up for you.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

MakeColor is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "MakeColor"
```
